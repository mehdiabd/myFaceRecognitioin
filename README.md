# myFaceRecognition

Here is my face recognition project. Please pay attention to run dataset.py first of all, to gather data (your face captures) using your IP webcam server to connect to your IP camera(s).
Then you must run train.py to train the algorithm using the images within "dataset" folder.
And finally please run the recognize.py. It does the face recognition based on dataset you provided and it creates a log file that shows you which people have passed the gate and when.
Good luck and have fun!
